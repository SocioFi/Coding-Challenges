# Simple Sentiment Analysis using Decision Tree

## Brief Explanation of Approach
The sentiment analysis model uses a decision tree classifier to determine whether a given text expresses positive or negative sentiment. The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset of text snippets with binary sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

## Assumptions
- The input dataset (`sentiment_dataset.csv`) is well-formatted and contains sufficient examples for training the model.
- The decision tree is a simple model for demonstration purposes and may not capture complex linguistic features.

## Instructions to Run
1. Install the necessary dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the `solution3.py` file to train the decision tree model.
3. Test the model using the provided sample input.
